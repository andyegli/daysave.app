can you provide detailed explanation how sso authentication works and provide a database model and a .puml sequence diagram

‚úÖ Summary
Topic	        Key
SSO	            Login once, access many systems
Protocols	    SAML (XML), OIDC (JWT)
IdP	            Handles the login process
SP (your app)	Validates and uses SSO tokens
Security	    Signed tokens, expiration, audience checking
Database	    Maps users to SSO IdP via subject ID


üîê What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?
SSO is an authentication process that allows a user to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without logging in again for each one.

For example:

You log in to your company‚Äôs identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD), and then you can access Gmail, Slack, or your internal HR portal without additional logins.

üåê SSO Architecture
Term	                    Description
Identity Provider (IdP)	    Authenticates users (e.g., Okta, Google Workspace)
Service Provider (SP)	    The app/site the user wants to access (e.g., Jira, GitLab)
SSO Protocols	            Mostly SAML 2.0, OIDC (OpenID Connect), or CAS

üîÑ How SAML SSO Works (Common in Enterprises)
1. User tries to access the Service Provider (SP) (your app)
2. SP redirects the user to the Identity Provider (IdP)
3. The user logs in once with the IdP
4. IdP sends a signed SAML assertion/token back to the SP
5. SP validates the token and logs the user in
üîÑ How OIDC SSO Works (Modern OAuth-based)
OIDC (OpenID Connect) is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and is more API-friendly.

Simplified Flow:

User clicks ‚ÄúLogin via Company SSO‚Äù

Your app (SP) redirects the user to the IdP‚Äôs authorization endpoint

User logs in (or already is) and approves

IdP redirects back with an authorization code

Your app exchanges the code for ID Token + Access Token

You validate the ID Token (JWT) and extract user info

Log in or register the user in your system

‚úÖ Use Cases for SSO

Enterprise user onboarding

Reducing password fatigue

Enforcing centralized policies (MFA, audit logs, etc.)

üìÑ Database Schema for SSO

This schema allows:

SSO login for any user

Supporting multiple IdPs (e.g., Azure AD, Okta)

Keeping track of mappings from your app to external IdPs


CREATE TABLE user_profile (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  display_name VARCHAR(100),
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE auth_sso_connections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES user_profile(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sso_provider VARCHAR(100),             -- e.g., "okta", "azure_ad"
  sso_subject_id VARCHAR(255),           -- unique user ID from IdP
  idp_metadata JSONB,                    -- optional SAML metadata
  last_login TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE (sso_provider, sso_subject_id)
);

actor User
participant "Your App\n(Service Provider)" as SP
participant "Identity Provider\n(IdP: e.g. Okta)" as IdP
participant "Your Database" as DB

User -> SP : Clicks ‚ÄúLogin via SSO‚Äù
SP -> IdP : Redirect to authorization endpoint
User -> IdP : Login & Consent
IdP -> SP : Redirect with authorization code

SP -> IdP : Exchange code for ID token
IdP -> SP : Return ID token (JWT)

SP -> SP : Validate JWT signature
SP -> DB : Find or create user by ID token email
SP -> User : Authenticated + Redirected
