You're asking for a re-evaluation of Evernote, followed by a list of similar projects, including the ones you've previously mentioned. Evernote is a very broad note-taking and organization tool, so the alternatives will cover a wide range of functionalities.


**Evernote (https://evernote.com/)**

Description: Evernote is a well-established, proprietary, cloud-based note-taking and organization application. It's designed to capture, organize, and find information across various formats (text, images, audio, web clippings, PDFs) and syncs across all devices. It has evolved to include tasks, calendar integration, and increasingly, AI-powered features.
Pros:
Feature-rich: Offers a comprehensive suite of tools for note-taking, task management, web clipping, document scanning, PDF annotation, and more.
Powerful Search: Excellent search capabilities, including searching text within images and PDFs.
Web Clipper: One of the most mature and robust web clippers available, allowing clean saves of articles, full pages, or selected content.
Cross-Platform Sync: Seamlessly syncs notes across all major operating systems and devices (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Web).
Integrations: Connects with many other services (Google Calendar, Slack, Microsoft Teams).
AI Features: Incorporating AI for transcription, summarizing, rewriting, and enhanced search.
Cons:
Proprietary & Cloud-Based: Not open-source, and all data is stored on Evernote's servers, raising privacy concerns for some users. No self-hosting option.
Cost: The free tier is very limited (e.g., 50 notes, 1 notebook, 1 device, 250 MB monthly uploads). Full functionality requires a paid subscription, which has seen price increases over time.
Bloat/Complexity: For simple note-taking, it can feel overly complex or "bloated" with features many users might not need.
Past Instability/Changes: Has gone through periods of ownership changes and significant app rewrites, leading to user dissatisfaction with performance or UI changes.

**2. Open-Source & Self-Hosted Read-it-Later Apps (for saving articles to read later, often with a clean reader view):**

**Omnivore (https://omnivore.app/):**
Description: An open-source, free "read-it-later" application designed for comfortable reading of articles and documents, with highlighting, note-taking, and integrations.
Pros: Open-source, offers a free hosted service, excellent reading experience, robust highlighting and note-taking, newsletter integration, RSS support, and good integrations with PKM tools like Obsidian/Logseq. Can fetch full content for offline reading.
Cons: While open-source, self-hosting can be challenging due to its reliance on specific cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud). Some users report self-hosting as not being a primary focus for the developers.

**Wallabag (https://www.wallabag.it/):**
Description: A mature and popular open-source "read-it-later" application that allows you to save web pages for offline reading in a clean, distraction-free view.
Pros: Long-standing, mature, and popular open-source. Self-hostable (PHP-based), offers a clean reading view, tagging, archiving, and offline access. Good browser extensions and mobile apps.
Cons: The UI can feel a bit dated compared to modern alternatives. Might lack advanced AI features like automatic tagging or summarization.

**Readeck (https://github.com/Readeck/readeck):**
Description: A self-hosted read-it-later service with a focus on highlighting and note-taking features, providing a clean interface for reading.
Pros: Self-hosted, open-source (AGPL-3.0), includes highlighting and note-taking. Aims for a polished user experience.
Cons: Might lack a dedicated client for full offline use (though the web interface is fast). Newer compared to Wallabag, so its feature set might evolve.

**3. Open-Source & Self-Hosted Bookmark Managers (focused on saving links, often with organization features like tags, collections, and sometimes archiving):**

**Linkwarden (https://linkwarden.app/ / https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden):**
Description: An open-source, self-hostable bookmark manager that excels at comprehensive archiving of saved links, including screenshots and full-page HTML.
Pros: Open-source, self-hostable. Excellent features for comprehensive archiving (screenshots, PDF, single HTML file, Wayback Machine integration). Supports local AI tagging, collaborative collections, multi-user support, full-text search, and browser extensions. Actively developed with a modern UI.
Cons: Primarily a bookmark manager; its "reading experience" might not be as optimized as dedicated read-it-later apps.

**linkding (https://linkding.link/ / https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding):**
Description: A simple, fast, and self-hosted bookmark manager focusing on essential features like tagging, searching, and optional archiving.
Pros: Self-hosted, simple, fast, and easy to set up (Docker-focused). Offers automatic metadata fetching, optional archiving (local HTML or Internet Archive), multi-user support, browser extensions, and a REST API. Designed to be minimal and focused.
Cons: More focused on core bookmarking than a full "read-it-later" experience with deep article parsing/reading views. UI is intentionally minimal, which might not appeal to everyone.

**LinkAce (https://www.linkace.org/):**
Description: A self-hosted bookmark archive that emphasizes robust organization, link monitoring, and archiving capabilities.
Pros: Self-hosted bookmark archive with a strong focus on organization (tags, lists), continuous link monitoring, automatic archiving to Internet Archive, multi-user support with SSO, powerful search, and a REST API. Clean interface.
Cons: May not have the same level of full-page local archiving as Linkwarden or ArchiveBox.

**Shiori (https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori):**
Description: A simple, self-hostable bookmark manager written in Go, aiming to be a minimalist alternative to services like Pocket for saving links.
Pros: Simple, self-hostable bookmark manager written in Go, describes itself as a "simple clone of Pocket." Emphasizes minimalism, includes its own page rendering for local archiving.
Cons: Lacks advanced features like AI tagging or extensive collaboration. Browser extensions might still be in beta.

Description: A personal, minimalist, and very fast bookmarking service that is unique in its database-free approach.
Pros: Personal, minimalist, super-fast, database-free bookmarking service. Self-hostable. Good for quick link sharing.

4. Open-Source & Self-Hosted General Note-Taking & Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) with Web Clipping:

**Memos (https://github.com/usememos/memos):**
Description: An open-source, self-hostable, privacy-focused, lightweight note-taking service. It's great for quick jotting down of thoughts, ideas, and daily notes, similar to a personal microblog.
Pros: Extremely lightweight, fast, easy to deploy (Docker), Markdown support, good for capturing fleeting thoughts. Focuses on privacy and self-hosting.
Cons: Not designed as a dedicated "read-it-later" or full-page archiving tool. While you can drop links, it won't necessarily render them into a clean reading view or save full pages. More for general note-taking and idea capture.

**Karakeep-app (https://github.com/karakeep-app/):**
Description: An open-source project that aims to be a self-hosted solution for "hoarding your digital life," focusing on saving web content, notes, and other digital assets.
Pros: Open-source, self-hostable, aims for comprehensive digital hoarding. Potentially offers good control over your data.
Cons: Project might be in active development or have varying levels of maturity. Specific features and stability would need to be verified.

**Obsidian (with Web Clipper plugin):**
Description: A powerful, local-first personal knowledge management system that uses plain Markdown files, extendable with a vast plugin ecosystem, including web clipping.
Pros: Local-first (Markdown files), extremely powerful PKM system with bidirectional linking, graph view, and a vast plugin ecosystem. The official Web Clipper allows capturing web content, converting it to Markdown, extracting metadata, and even using AI (via API) to summarize or interpret content. You retain full control over your data.
Cons: The core app is free, but syncing across devices for end-to-end encryption or publishing might require paid services (Obsidian Sync/Publish) or setting up your own sync solution (e.g., Syncthing). The web clipper outputs Markdown, not necessarily a "reader mode" in the traditional sense, though you can use templates to format it.

**Joplin (https://joplinapp.org/):**
Description: A free, open-source note-taking and to-do application that supports Markdown, rich text, and features a web clipper to save web pages.
Pros: Open-source, full-featured note-taking app with a robust web clipper (Chrome, Firefox). Supports Markdown, rich text, various syncing options (Nextcloud, Dropbox, WebDAV, etc.), end-to-end encryption, and a good tag/notebook system. Can save full web pages.
Cons: The web clipper captures the page but the "reading experience" within Joplin isn't always as polished as dedicated "read-it-later" apps.

**Notesnook (https://notesnook.com/):**
Description: An open-source, zero-knowledge encrypted note-taking app with cross-platform support and a web clipper.
Pros: Open-source, zero-knowledge encryption, cross-platform note-taking app with a dedicated web clipper. Emphasizes privacy and security. Supports Markdown, rich text, and various organization features.
Cons: While it has a web clipper, its primary function is note-taking, so the "read-it-later" features might not be as advanced as specialized tools.

**Trilium Notes (https://github.com/zadam/trilium):**
Description: A self-hostable, hierarchical note-taking application designed for building a personal knowledge base with support for various content types, including web clippings.
Pros: Self-hostable, hierarchical note-taking application designed for building a personal knowledge base. Features rich text editing, code highlighting, web clipper, and synchronization with a self-hosted server. Can handle a large volume of notes.
Cons: Cross-platform support for desktop is good, but mobile support is limited or requires a self-hosted sync server for web access. Can be more complex to set up initially than simpler tools.

**TagSpaces (with Web Clipper) (https://www.tagspaces.org/ / https://www.tagspaces.org/products/webclipper/):**
Description: An open-source, desktop-based file browser that emphasizes tagging for organization, with a web clipper to save web content locally.
Pros: Open-source, desktop-based file browser that uses tags for organization. Its web clipper allows saving web content locally as HTML, MHTML, or PDFs, ensuring offline access and privacy. Integrates well with the TagSpaces app for local organization and searching.
Cons: The main application is a file browser, not a traditional "note-taking" or "read-it-later" app, which might be a different workflow for some.

**5. Open-Source & Self-Hosted Comprehensive Web Archiving:**

**ArchiveBox (https://archivebox.io/ / https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox):**
Description: A highly powerful and versatile self-hosted tool designed for comprehensive web archiving, preserving web content in multiple formats to combat link rot.

Description: A suite of open-source tools that provide professional-grade solutions for archiving complex, dynamic, and interactive web content.
Pros: Professional-grade open-source tools for archiving dynamic, interactive web content. Excellent for preserving complex websites or specific user interactions.
