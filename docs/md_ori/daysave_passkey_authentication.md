can you provide detailed explanaation how passkey authentication works and provide a database model and a .puml sequence diagram


‚úÖ Summary
Passkeys are passwordless, phishing-resistant, and device-bound.

Based on FIDO2 + WebAuthn: public/private key cryptography.

Database stores public key, credential ID, and metadata per user.

Login is secure, fast, and often done via biometrics.

What is Passkey Authentication?
üîê Overview
Passkey authentication is a passwordless authentication method based on FIDO2/WebAuthn standards. It uses public-key cryptography to authenticate a user securely without needing passwords.

üß† How It Works (Plain English)
Instead of typing a password:

The device (e.g. phone or laptop) creates a public/private key pair for each service.

The private key stays securely on your device (e.g. in a secure enclave or TPM).

The public key is sent to the service and stored in the database.

Later, when you log in:

The server sends a challenge.

The user unlocks their device (Face ID, fingerprint, PIN).

The device signs the challenge with the private key.

The server verifies the signature using the public key.

No password is ever transmitted or stored.

Sequence Diagram (.puml)
Here‚Äôs a sequence diagram that shows the registration and login process with passkeys using the WebAuthn standard.

üìå PlantUML (.puml)

@startuml Passkey_Auth_Sequence
actor User
participant "Browser/Device" as Client
participant "Web Server\n(Backend API)" as Server
participant "Database"
participant "Authenticator\n(e.g. Secure Enclave)" as Authenticator

== Registration (Creating Passkey) ==

User -> Client : Start registration
Client -> Server : Request registration challenge
Server -> Database : Lookup user / create registration record
Server -> Client : Return challenge (random + user ID)
Client -> Authenticator : Create public/private key pair
Client -> Server : Send public key + credential ID
Server -> Database : Store public key, credential ID

== Login (Authentication) ==

User -> Client : Start login
Client -> Server : Request authentication challenge
Server -> Database : Fetch public key and credential ID
Server -> Client : Return challenge + credential ID
Client -> Authenticator : Sign challenge with private key
Client -> Server : Send signature
Server -> Database : Verify signature with stored public key
Server -> Client : Authenticated!

üóÉÔ∏è Part 3: Database Model for Passkey Authentication
Here‚Äôs a minimal and secure database schema using SQL and UML for storing WebAuthn credentials.

üîë Key Concepts:
Each passkey is tied to a user.

You must store:

Credential ID (unique to device)

Public key

Authenticator information

Counter (to prevent replay attacks)

Transports (USB, NFC, internal, etc.)

Attestation format and metadata (optional)

SQL Schema (PostgreSQL/MySQL compatible)
 
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    display_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE webauthn_credentials (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    credential_id BYTEA UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- base64url decoded
    public_key BYTEA NOT NULL,           -- base64url decoded
    sign_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,        -- counter to detect cloning
    transports TEXT[],                   -- e.g., ["usb", "ble", "internal"]
    user_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_used TIMESTAMP
);
üß≠ Entity Relationship (ERD) as PlantUML

@startuml passkey erd
entity "users" {
  *id : UUID <<PK>>
  --
  email : VARCHAR
  display_name : VARCHAR
  created_at : TIMESTAMP
}

entity "webauthn_credentials" {
  *id : UUID <<PK>>
  --
  user_id : UUID <<FK>>
  credential_id : BYTEA
  public_key : BYTEA
  sign_count : INT
  transports : TEXT[]
  user_verified : BOOLEAN
  created_at : TIMESTAMP
  last_used : TIMESTAMP
}

users ||--o{ webauthn_credentials : "has"
